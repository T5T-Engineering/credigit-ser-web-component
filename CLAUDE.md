# credigit-ser-web-component — `@credigit/web-ui`

The single source of every UI control used by Credigit apps. Read `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` (component rules and APIs) and `docs/BOLT-DESIGN.md` (visual language) before adding or changing a component.

## Project invariants (apply to every Credigit SER repository)

1. **Every UI control is a shared library component first.** Any control, widget or visual building block used in a frontend (credigit-ser-frontend, credigit-ser-landing, or any future app) must be created in **credigit-ser-web-component** (`@credigit/web-ui`) first, then imported by the apps. Apps contain only routes, page compositions, data access, domain logic and copy — never their own buttons, inputs, tables, cards, charts, dialogs or similar. If a control is missing, add it to the library (with tests and docs in `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`), release it to the library `develop` branch, then use it in the app.
2. **Brand comes from tokens, never hard-coded values.** Colours, fonts and logos are runtime-configurable per tenant (BrandProvider: `updateBrand({ colors, logos, font })`). Use only the theme utilities; never hex colours, palette classes or font names in components or apps. Default font: Baloo 2.
3. **Design language: Bolt (bolt.eu).** Component design follows `credigit-ser-web-component/docs/BOLT-DESIGN.md` (pills, squircle surfaces, bold type, soft elevation) with Credigit colours, Baloo 2 and the Credigit logo.
4. **The PRD is the product source of truth.** `credigit-ser-claude-works/README.md` (Smart Enterprise Risk 360° PRD v2.1). Don't invent regulatory rules, formulas, weights, limits or provider endpoints; record ambiguities as open questions.
5. **Git workflow.** Work on a feature branch → merge (`--no-ff`) into local `develop` → push `origin develop`. Every remote has `develop`, `test`, `uat`, `staging`, `production`; never commit directly to the environment branches.
6. **Dependencies:** latest stable/LTS versions, pinned exactly.
7. **No secrets in repositories** (credigit-ser-web-component is public).
8. **No hard-coded values — business rules drive behaviour (frontend and backend).** Limits, thresholds, rates, durations, URLs, role/route mappings, labels of configurable things and similar values must come from the application's business rules (Rules & Parameters engine / tenant configuration / environment config), never literals in code. Any temporary exception is recorded in the repo's `TECH-DEBT.md` with an ID referenced in the code.
9. **Every feature is complete end-to-end.** For everything being worked on:
   - **User-scoped:** data, actions and views respect the signed-in user, their role, tenant and permissions.
   - **Audited:** every state change writes to the immutable audit log (who, what, before/after, when, where).
   - **Notified:** relevant parties receive notifications; build the notification HTML message template if one doesn't exist.
   - **Workflow-routed:** anything needing approval is routed through the **"Operations" workflow** (configurable steps, approvers, SLAs) — no ad-hoc approval logic.
   - **Extensible and externally reachable:** expose subscribe-able **hook points** (before/after, can veto or enrich) and **event points** (publishers of domain events) that external systems can subscribe to (outbound webhooks / message publishers) and act through (inbound APIs), so other systems communicate with this application without changing core code.
   - **Rule-driven:** replace every hard-coded value with a business rule (invariant 8).
   - **Connector-ready:** identify every integration connector point (e.g. core banking, credit bureaus, CBN / CRMS, market data, e-mail / SMS; inbound or outbound; real-time or batch) and record it in the repo's `docs/integration-points.md` (create it on first entry) with direction, trigger, payload / contract and owning module. Connectors plug in through the Connectors framework, never ad-hoc calls.
   - **Navigable:** wire up all necessary menus and sub-menus for the feature.
   - **Consistent:** respect every other invariant in this list.
10. **Caveman communication.** Agents (Claude) talk caveman to the team: short words, no filler, no pleasantries, fragments fine. Technical terms, numbers, file paths, commands and error text stay exact. Applies to chat replies and status updates only. Product copy, docs, code comments, commit messages and PR text stay normal professional English.
11. **Clear context after every push.** After every push to `origin`, the agent ends its turn with a short handoff (what was pushed, commit hash, next step) and tells the user to run `/clear`. Agents cannot run `/clear` themselves (built-in CLI command). Anything the next session needs must already be in the repo (CLAUDE.md, README, TECH-DEBT.md, open questions) before the push.
12. **Permission-driven actions.** Every possible action (every view, button, menu item, API endpoint, command, query, export, approval and configuration change) is guarded by a named permission from the Identity & Access permission catalogue, checked in the backend and mirrored in the UI. No action is allowed by role name or hard-coded checks. Every permission is granted to the **System Admin** role by default (tenants may revoke). Holding a permission does not bypass the Operations workflow: approver eligibility, four-eyes and segregation of duties still apply.

### In this repo
- New components: right group under `src/components/<group>/`, exported from the group barrel, documented in `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` §5, with Vitest tests; `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm test` must pass.
- Consumers install from GitHub (`git+https://github.com/T5T-Engineering/credigit-ser-web-component.git#develop`); after pushing, apps run `npm update @credigit/web-ui`.
